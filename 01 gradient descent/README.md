Stochastic Gradient Descent
====

This IPython notebook gives a tutorial for implementing gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent in Python. This work is based on the algorithm described by Andrew Ng in Stanford CS 229 course. See http://cs229.stanford.edu/ for more info.
The ipynb file should be viewable as HTML on GitHub if you don't have iPython installed locally.
